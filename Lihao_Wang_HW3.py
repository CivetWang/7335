# Decision Making With Matrices

# This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations. 

# The problem is: you and your work friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a restaurant thatâ€™s best for everyone.  Then you should decide if you should split into two groups so everyone is happier.  

# Despite the simplicity of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
  
# This process was thoroughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approach can prove helpful on any number of decision making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.  

# Transform the restaurant data into a matrix (M_resturants) using the same column index.

# The most important idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.  
# Informally describe what a linear combination is  and how it will relate to our restaurant matrix.

# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent? 

# Next, compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent? 

# Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get the optimal restaurant for all users.  What do the entries represent?

# Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   Do the same as above to generate the optimal restaurant choice.  

# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does it represent in the real world?

# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem? 

# Find  user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.  

# Should you split into two groups today? 

# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust? Now what is the best restaurant?

# Tomorrow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal ordering for restaurants. Can you find their weight matrix? 


# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following dictionary object.
